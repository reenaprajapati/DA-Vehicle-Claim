### Module Split-up

## 1.Data collection-(Done by all)
    The data is required in order to process visualization. So we should collect data from the user and then process, analyze, visualize and so on. The only process we are carrying manually is the data collection. This is a manual process. This process is done by distributing forms to the subscribed users. The different type of vehicle insurance details of different customers will be collected by using the Google forms and it will be stored as a CSV file in a database.
    
## 2.Data Cleaning-Sathyan
      
	Data cleaning will be performed in python by using Python’s Pandas and NumPy libraries to use clean data
We will cover the following:
•	Dropping unnecessary columns in a Data Frame
•	Changing the index of a Data Frame
•	Using .str() methods to clean columns
•	Using the DataFrame.applymap() function to clean the entire dataset, element-wise
•	Renaming columns to a more recognizable set of labels
•	Skipping unnecessary rows and columns in a  file
After the data cleaning will be completed that data will be stored in database with .CSV extension

## 3.Analysing
  3.1 K-Means-Vinayagamoorthy
  3.3 Linear Regression-Reena
  3.3 Decision Tree-Reena
  The cleaned data will be retrieved from the database and it will be analyzed based on the customer needs and problems. It will be performed by following steps
  
1 .Define a problem-The main objective will be defined
	2 .Determine the problem-
	3 .Design the problem-the problem and its solution will be designed
	4 .Analyze the problem
	5 .Sample
	6 .Report- The report will be generated in a form of charts and graphs
Those graphs and charts will be used to perform a multiple operation like comparison and prediction 

KMEANS, Linear Regression are the algorithms to use for the analysis process.

  
## 4.Comaprision&prediction
  4.1 Visualyzing-Vinayagamoorthy
  4.2 Tableau-Reena
  
## comparision
  he analyzed data will be visualized in many forms of charts and graphs. These charts and graphs will be used to perform a comparison operation. Comparison is carried out for better understanding of data. We can compare it with our previous data and can predict our growth in which business call YOY called as year on year growth. Data must be compared for better understanding of ourselves. The data activity will be compared year by year and find the percentage rate of claim, deduction, income rate and   other details.	
## Prediction
	We should be able to predict the future responses. However the prediction may not be accurate. Data prediction is best when carried out with data comparison. Sometimes prediction can save us from huge disastrous for instance, when YOY starts decreasing, it can be a warning to change our strategy.



## ABSTRACT
           A system that helps in visualizing and analysing the motor insurance vehicle claims. It distributes interactive and sharable dashboards which depict the trends variations and density of the data in form of graphs and charts. It will be  useful for future prediction and comparison of data.Claims analysis is a technique for examining the positive and negative consequences of design features that are described in current or future scenarios of use. A "claim" is a statement of the consequences of a specific design feature or artifact on users and other stakeholders. This system is planned to build using the TABLEAU software to visualise the data.
   
## FUTURE ENHANCEMENT
           In future the system is going to make the project more flexible for adapting new technologies.Also we have a plan to process artificial intelligence in our project.Support will always be given to all our customers and any queries regarding to our project will be resolved.Additional tools will be added and the feedback,support page will be added so that the user’s opinion will be considered.
Constant updates will be provided and security will always be in a consideration and will be improved.Data security is our top priority and we make sure any data without our knowledge will not be leaked.

## ADVANTAGE:

1.Working on large number of data using TABLEAU
2.Classify the insurance claim details
3.Visualizing the data in the form of charts and graphs.
4.Predict the types of claims.
5.Future Prediction
